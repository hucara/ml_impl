# ml_impl: Machine Learning algorithms implementation

A compendium of machine learning algorithms implemented in python. Some in notebooks and some also as machine learning in an object oriented fashion.

This project contains:
* Implementation of ML algorithms with explanation and working examples for self educational purposes.
* Most of the pictures are taken from the courses of Andrew NG in Coursera, which I highly recommend.
* Most of the stuff here was inspired by the courses of Andrew NG in Coursera, which I highly recommend.
* There may be formulas which don't show correctly. In jupyter they do probably due to difference in Latex formula flavors between jupyter and github.
* OO implementation of machine learning algorithms, all trying to be based on the abstract class in abs_model.py.
